what is sidecar?
ANS: additional container is deployed alongside a primary container within the same pod 
     A sidecar container can capture logs(collect metrics and monitoring data) generated by the primary container and 
     send them to monitoring systems like Prometheus.

Consider there is a issue with application, manager ask you to send logs? There are 100s of pods how you take logs of these pods ?which log tool guys are using ? How you share logs to the manager?
ANS:using grafana,we have to navigate to the relevant dashboard and find which pod is causing it and Use Prometheus queries 
   or Grafana's built-in querying capabilities to filter logs based on pod names, labels, namespaces, or specific time ranges.
   Once you've filtered the logs to include only those from the relevant pods, Grafana typically allows you to export logs. export logs for a specific time range and we share with manager using sharepoint or email or teams
